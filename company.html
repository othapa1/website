        <h1>Built from platform engineering.<br>Applied to AI systems.</h1>
        <p class="lede">
          LotusNex was formed by engineers with deep backgrounds in enterprise platform delivery—cloud architecture, reliability engineering, DevSecOps, and large-scale integration—who saw a consistent pattern: AI systems failing in production not because the models were wrong, but because the surrounding systems were not engineered.

          <h3>The problem we were built to solve.</h3>
          <p>
            Most AI failures are not model failures. They are architecture failures—missing evaluation harnesses, undefined tool boundaries, absent observability, no clear ownership. These are solved engineering problems in every other domain of software infrastructure. We apply that discipline to AI.

        <h2>How we are structured</h2>
        <p class="lede" style="margin-bottom: 28px;">
          We operate as a senior engineering firm, not a staffing model. Engagements are led and executed by engineers with production experience across enterprise platforms, federal programs, and B2B SaaS delivery. We keep engagements small by design—tight scope, clear interfaces, measurable outcomes.
        </p>

    <!-- OPERATING PRINCIPLES -->

            <h3>We work on systems, not experiments.</h3>
            <p>
              Every engagement is scoped around production constraints: real users, real data, real operational burden. We do not build pilots that cannot be hardened. If a system cannot be evaluated, monitored, and owned, it is not ready to ship.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="pov">
            <h3>We prefer fewer, more serious engagements.</h3>
            <p>
              LotusNex is selective about the work we take on. We engage where there is a real architectural problem, where the team has production intent, and where rigorous delivery is valued. Volume is not our model.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="pov">
            <h3>We build for the team that inherits the system.</h3>
            <p>
              Clean handoff is not optional. Runbooks, interface documentation, observability baselines, and ownership clarity are part of every delivery. The measure of good systems work is what happens after we leave.
